                    <p style="margin-top:-2 0px;text-align:center;"><i> – Rachel Carson</i></p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Sense of smell can change our moods incessantly and tremendously . Have you ever realized the importance of deodorant that you spray on yourself every morning? A good fragrance can bring freshness to the mind and make you feel more confident. The smell of earth when it rains is a comfort of its own.  Aromas are used to calm the mind and widely used in therapy sessions. The ancient practice of adorning hair with flowers also comes from the same reasons and roots. Thus, it is amply clear how directly our sense of smell can influence how we feel in our environment, not just how we smell it.</p>


                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                    <img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/twoone.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kjFRSbCox_k/UbGrWlVZ3zI/AAAAAAAACpI/ P43r4AdnVNw/s1600/4.+Mr+Labrador+and+the+Lily+by+What.jpg</p>
                    <div>




                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The olfactory system is the sensory system used for smelling. The main olfactory system detects airborne substances, while the accessory system senses fluid-phase stimuli. It gives information to the brain about chemical compositions of objects around. Olfaction in humans has a role in adding emotional attributes to certain events and objects and it is vital in processing our environment and remembering it. </p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">One’s characteristic smell is thought to be an attribute of sophistication and complexity, and more than often, personalities get associated with it. Also, the sense of smell is closely related to the sense of taste as dissolved chemicals in food or drink can evaporate and stimulate olfactory receptors.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">These two would enable one to achieve a lot of things in multitude of fields like entertainment , Science ,etc.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Highly sensitive, we have as many as 350 different receptors identifying distinct, particular parts of molecules. An individual molecule can stimulate different receptors in different ways, leading to innumerable smells being identified.</p>


                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                    <img class="square" id ="three" src="images1/twotwo.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/smell-olfaction-epithelium-cilia-olfactory-sensory-neurons-and-basal-cells.jpg</p>
                    <div>




                    <p style="text-align:justify">Now delving into the science behind being able to perceive via smell, focus must be brought to the term olfactory receptors (ORs). Also known as odorant receptors, they are present in the cell membranes of olfactory receptor neurons. They are responsible for the detection of odorants (compounds that have an odor). Activated olfactory receptors trigger nerve impulses which transmit information about odor to the brain.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Technology is already harnessing the scope of this innate sense and also looking into how to substitute for it, while making it further sensitive.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">A step in this direction is an electronic nose. A device intended to detect odors,it was developed in order to mimic human olfaction so that an odor is perceived as a global fingerprint. Essentially the instrument consists of headspace sampling, sensor array, and pattern recognition modules, to generate signal pattern that is used for characterizing odors.</p>



                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                    <img class="square" id ="four" src="images1/twothree.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy:http://s3images.coroflot.com/user_files/ 1Ym1HXke2UTyq36M4S1UI9x_0.jpg</p>
                    <div>



                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Electronic noses include three major parts: a sample delivery system, a detection system, a computing system.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The sample delivery system enables the generation of the headspace (volatile compounds) of a sample, which is the fraction analyzed. The system then injects this headspace into the detection system of the electronic nose. The sample delivery system is essential to guarantee constant operating conditions.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The detection system, which consists of a sensor set, is the "reactive" part of the instrument. When in contact with volatile compounds, the sensors react, which means they experience a change of electrical properties.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The computing system works to combine the responses of all of the sensors, which represents the input for the data treatment. This part of the instrument performs global fingerprint analysis and provides results and representations that can be easily interpreted.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Another interesting development in this sector is machine Olfaction. This is the automated simulation of the sense of smell.</p>


                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                    <img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/twofour.jpg" alt="" />

                    </div>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">It is an emerging application of modern engineering where robots or other automated systems are needed to measure the existence of a particular chemical concentration in air. The entire system is a means of converting complex sensor responses into an output that is a qualitative profile of the odor using a complex mixture of chemical volatiles that make up a smell.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Odor localization is the technique and process of finding the location of a volatile chemical source in a certain environment with one or several odor sensors. It is vital for both food searching and danger avoiding.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Mention needs to be made of another extremely useful creation- an olfactometer. This is an instrument used to detect and measure odor dilution.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">They are used to measure intensity,by introducing an odorous gas as a baseline against which other odors are compared. A flow-olfactometer is a complex instrument for creation of well defined, reproducible smell or pain stimuli in the nose without tactile or thermal stimulation.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This technology can be further developed to relieve human moods effectively as smell is responsible for bringing in sense of pleasures, freshness and lucidity of mind.</p>

                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                    <img class="square" id ="three" src="images1/twofive.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy:www.researchgate.net</p>
                    </div>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The detection of lung cancer or other medical conditions can employ olfactory means. It can also be used to detect certain bacterial and viral infections. It may also be used as a bomb detection method in airports. Through careful placement of several or more electronic noses and effective computer systems you could triangulate the location of bombs to within a few metres of their location in less than a few seconds.</p>
                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Thus, the olfactory sense could have unbelievable attributes if we consider its capacity to modulate human behaviors. It has determinant roles in the evolution of human habitat, and, most important of all, in the social behavior.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The beauty of any sense at all shines through best when in association with other senses. As we work to further these developments and focus on impacting society with them, every once in a while, we must remember to breathe it all in and respect our ability to. </p>
                          <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Just. Breathe.</p>

										<p style="text-align:justify;">After the sense of vision, sense of hearing or Audition is what enables us to perceive the world better.  Sense of hearing gives a new dimension and dynamic to our experiences. Sense of Hearing which is also known as auditory perception makes us better  aware of the surroundings. Unlike the sense of vision , we can hear all the sounds which we are surrounded with . Sense of hearing also gives us a sense of directionality in a more enhanced way compared to the sense of vision.</p>

										<p style="text-align:justify;">Now let us get to the biological aspect of the sense of hearing, that means science.</br>Hearing is the detecting and perception of the sound waves in the air. </br>The organs which look like the horn of a phonograph - Ears; ears focus the sounds waves through the ear canal onto the ear drum. </p>

										<div>




										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The eardrum acts like a diaphragm, and vibrates to the incoming sound waves . These vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear by a chain of tiny bones. From the inner ear, auditory nerve carries the sound information to the brain where it is processed , perceived and stored. One is always listening , from the moment they’re born. 365 days 24 hours, even when you’re sleeping . This is a lot of information the brain is being fed and this information plays an important role in cognitive learning.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Now , there are various reasons why one would want to build a machine counterpart which achieves similar functionalities. Some of them are listed below.</p>
										<ul style="margin-top:-20px;margin-down:-20px;"><li style="text-align:left;">Sound recording and analysis</li><li  style="text-align:left;">Sound amplification</li></ul>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">These two would enable one to achieve a lot of things in multitude of fields like entertainment , Science ,etc.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">The machine/technological counterpart to achieve this functionality would be a microphone. A microphone is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. Over these years many different technologies have been developed which lay the basis for a microphone. Let’s look at the major technologies used today in consumer and prosumer fields</p>

										<h2 style="text-align:center;">1. Condenser Microphones</h2>

										<div style="text-align:center;">
										<span class="image"><img src="images1/twelve.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;margin-top:-40px;">Courtsey: http://www.neumann.com/homestudio/pictures/markiii_10045656</p>
										</div>



										<p style="text-align:justify">Condenser Microphones are based on the principle of a capacitor , condenser means capacitor . A capacitor is an electronic component which stores energy in form of an electrostatic field. </p>

										<div style="text-align:center;">
										<img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/thirteen.gif" alt="" />
										<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/images/mic-condenser.gif</p>
										<div>


										<p style="text-align:justify;">A capacitor has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser mic, one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power.</p>

										<p style="text-align:justify;">These kind are the most widely used in electronic gadgets and these tend to be more sensitive compared to others.This technology can also be shrunk in size , making it very versatile.</p>

										<h2 style="text-align:center;">2. Dynamic Microphones (Moving Coil Microphones)</h2>


										<div style="text-align:center;">
										<img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/fouteen.jpg" alt="" />
										<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/musical-instruments/detail-page/Nady_SP-4C.img1_lg.jpg</p>
										<div>



										<p style="text-align:justify;">The dynamic microphone (also known as the moving-coil microphone) works via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them ideal for onstage use.</p>

										<div style="text-align:center;">
										<img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/fifteen.jpg" alt="" />
										<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/dynamic-microphone.jpg</p>
										</div>


										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Dynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a loudspeaker, only reversed. A small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying current in the coil through electromagnetic induction. </p>


										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">These are the two widely used microphones, but there is another type of microphones which have been developed and are also being researched into, the MEMS microphone.</p>

										<div style="text-align:center;">
										<img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/sixteen.jpg" alt="" />
										<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: https://i0.wp.com/www.diffusionmagazine.com/images/akustica_340.jpg</p>
										</div>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The MEMS (Micro-Electrical-Mechanical System) microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. These have revolutionised product designs and have made their way into products like Amazon Alexa , Google Home and certain phones. </p>



										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Microphones have now existed for a long time since their invention in 1876 by Emile Berliner. The growing advancements in the microphone technologies are opening up doors for creative applications. Better microphones along with machine learning and processing via Artificial Intelligence have led to things like Speech Recognition , which would be deemed magic a decade ago. </p>


										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">All in all , sense of hearing is one of the fundamental thing which enhances our perception of our surroundings and goes hand in hand with the sense of vision. The technology for the sense of hearing enables one to share their perception with others . The ability to record , playback and edit these sounds further enables one to build a whole new world of possibilities.</p>

										<p style="text-align:justify;">The interpretation of the surrounding environment using light in the visible spectrum reflected by the objects in the environment is called vision. The resulting perception is also known as visual perception, eyesight or sight. The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system, and are the focus of much research in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and molecular biology, collectively referred to as vision science.</p>

										</p>
									</div>


										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The act of seeing starts when the cornea and then the lens of the eye focuses light from its surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called the retina. The retina is part of the brain that is isolated to serve as a transducer for the conversion of light into neuronal signal. Based on feedback from the visual system, the lens of the eye adjusts its thickness to focus light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, also known as the rods and cones, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are processed via complex feed-forward and feed-back processes by different parts of the brain, from the retina upstream to central ganglia in the brain.</p>

									</div>


										<p style="text-align:justify;">The first device that comes to our mind, when the discussion is about technology substituting our sense of vision, is the camera. In this era, where Digital Single Reflex Lens (DSLR) Cameras are becoming increasingly popular, it would not be wrong to state that the camera is the digital and technological counterpart of our eyes, providing the same functionality: processing visual information (light) into digital information, just as our eyes process light information and biochemically convert them into neuro-electric impulses that are sent to brain.</p>

									</div>



										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Single-shot capture systems use either one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the primary additive colors red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter.</p>

									<div style="text-align:center;">
										<img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/four.jpg" alt="" />
										<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://chulsa.kr/files//298/1b6e72097c908d170a23138065d9f105.jpg</p>
									</div>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Multi-shot exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens aperture. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple shot method is called Microscanning. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.</p>

									</div>


										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The third method is called scanning because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an image scanner. The linear or tri-linear sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using color co-site sampling) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital rotating line camera offers images of very high total resolution.</p>

										<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;margin-top:-40px;">Courtesy: http://r2.officer.com/files/base/image/	/markiii_10045656.jpg</p>
									</div>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Although a camera is functionally largely similar to our eyes, it would not be wrong to state that the image developed does not exactly aid human vision, as the end product of these devices is a digital image or a visual hard copy, which have to be again processed by the eye as an image. Cameras may be similar to our eyes, but cannot be its substitute. Special hardware structures and software algorithms provide machines with the capability to interpret the images coming from a camera or a sensor. These signals from light sensing devices such as cameras or other sensors can be suitably modified to act as a signal source for a computer to interpret or converted into biological impulses that can directly stimulate sense of vision in humans.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">One such fascinating piece of technology is the Argus II. In a rare incurable genetic eye disorder <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b>, genetic mutations cause photoreceptors, the cells in the retina at the back of the eye that convert light into an electrical signal the brain can interpret, to stop working and die. Without functioning photoreceptors, people with <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b> go blind. But with the help of a retinal implant, formally known as Retinal Prosthesis System, or simply "bionic eye" called Argus II, some patients with the rare disorder have regained their sight.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">At best, these patients could detect only bright light. With the device implanted and turned on, some patients did significantly better on vision tests, like touching a white square on a black monitor and finding a door in real life. Beyond lab tests, visual rehabilitation experts evaluated the effects of the Argus II in the daily lives of patients. For 65% of the study participants, the device positively impacted their lives, improving their quality of life and their ability to perform basic tasks.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The Argus II system has two separate components: a camera and visual processing unit a patient wears, and the surgically implanted receiving antenna and electrodes. The camera and visual processing unit do what the photoreceptors in people with <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b> no longer can: convert visual information from light into electrical signals the brain can understand.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">An antenna on the glasses transmits the data from the camera and visual processing unit to a receiving antenna implanted into the patient. The data received goes to an array of 60 electrodes implanted over the macula, the part of the retina that is normally the most sensitive. The electrodes produce small pulses of electricity that stimulate the nerve cells still left in the retina, which then carry information about the stimulation to the part of the brain that interprets this into vision.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This technology is nothing less than a boon to the medical field, and a strong testimony of the capabilities of technology to aid in cases where medicine and natural physiology cannot achieve any better results. The Argus II received approval for commercial use in the European Union in March 2011. In February 2013, the FDA approved the Argus II under a humanitarian device exemption, authorizing its use for up to 4,000 people in the US per year. The Argus II was initially available at a limited number of clinics in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, at an EU market price of US$115,000. When the Argus II launched in the United States in February 2013, Second Sight announced that it would be priced at around $150,000, excluding the cost of surgery and usage training. In August 2013, Second Sight announced that reimbursement payments had been approved for the Argus II for blind Medicare recipients in the United States.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Though Argus II can provide satisfactory results, it is evident that the device can target only one particular disorder, with results better than before but not perfect sight. Advanced research is being undertaken to provide similar technological aid to serve a wider spectrum of visual disabilities, and also enable mass production of the same to provide the device at affordable prices. </p>
