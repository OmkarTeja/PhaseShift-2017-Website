                    </header>
                    <p style="text-align:center;">“To me, teaching is a holy calling.It’s the gift not only of not giving up on people, but of even figuring out where to begin.”</p>

                  </div>

                </div>
                <div class="spotlight">
                    <div class="content">
	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Anne Lammott explores these words in depth and beautifully in her work, “Stitches: A Handbook on Meaning, Hope and Repair.”</p>

	                    <p style="text-align: justify">While this book gives so much to discuss, here we will choose to focus on one particular aspect, and perhaps one of the most hard hitting aspects that one encounters while reading it-that never is there more of a need to not give up than there is in the field of teaching. A teacher’s effects never stop affecting, and the ripples cascade and spread out into the fabric of time, for as long as they can. Lessons taught and imbibed make their way from thought to thought, hand to hand and act to act.</p>

	                    <p style="text-align: justify">Realising this immense power they have - to change how thinking works - is only the beginning of the beginning of their art and service. The ones who do realise and devote their lives into making the most of this ability they have to influence how students analyse the world, and also how students see themselves and their role in the world, make for the most incredible of mentors to have.</p>

	                    <p style="text-align: justify">They become our anchors and our sails.</p>

	                    <p style="text-align: justify">A name that is almost synonymous with all the attributes we spoke of here and more is Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishna- a man who thought and taught.</p>




	                    <div style="text-align:center;">
	                    <img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/dr_radhakrishnan1.jpg" alt="" />
	                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;"></p>
	                    </div>




	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Teacher’s day is marked and celebrated on his birthday to uphold the qualities one should have, even if not a teacher by profession, to constantly learn from all that life has to teach us. These traits guide us in propagating  lessons and experiences to those around us, so as to empower each other with knowledge and do better as a whole.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Born on September 5th, 1988 in Tiruttani pilgrim village, his father was initially adamant that his son become a priest. However, having seen his sheer brilliance at academics, his father agreed that he should be allowed to study English as per his choice. Dr. S. Radhakrishnan was sent to receive an excellent schooling at Tirupati and then Vellore. His interest in philosophy happened by chance and once it did, there was no turning back. He was educated in philosophy in Madras Christian college.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">He had an undying desire to learn from one and all. This allowed him to make interesting points and comments in his work that had been inspired by his analysis of circumstances around him. He had incredible clarity of thought and a commendable hold on the language. This meant he was able to express even the most abstract and far fetched thoughts in words that could be comprehended easily and impactfully.These attributes, among others, set his work as a philosopher and thinker levels apart and above.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">His first work was published in 1908. Titled "The Ethics of the Vedanta and Its Material Presupposition", it was written as his thesis for the M.A. degree examination of the Madras University. However, apart from resulting in the fact that he graduated with flying colors, this work also made it clear that this was a man of paramount ability and a natural flair for philosophy that was unparalleled.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Although, his service to India is known to most in the form of his tenure as a President, he served his motherland in more ways than one even before he took on this prestigious post.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">During India’s struggle for independence, he was a speaker whose thoughts and views were revered. They helped encourage Indians to never stop in their fight. He headed a sort of “Cultural Therapy”, whereby he examined the nation’s traditions and practices. He understood the meaningfulness and innate and intricate reasoning behind them all. He spoke strongly and prudently about how Indians’ actions and culture had been inspired by brilliant logic.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Examining them from the point of view of western utility, he said that the westerners had much to learn from these rich values. In a time period when Indians were suffering from an acute sense of inferiority, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan reminded them about the fact that the British would take years to catch up with India’s thought process which was truly progressive and always had been.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">This help instilled a sense of confidence and pride in Indians. However, he was a man of forethought and not just one who spoke to pacify the present. He spoke with the times to come in mind.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">He believed that in India, the philosopher's duty was to keep in touch with the past while stretching out to the future. Thus he stressed on the fact that although India’s culture was wondrous, it needed to evolve with each passing day and with each circumstance, to better withstand the test of time. He said that the culture had to cut off and change all that was corrupt and abhorrent and move forward towards beneficial reforms.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">He strongly believed that philosophy was not just reflecting on life, but that it was a way of life. He inculcated it in sociopolitical arenas and used them to make it available to the masses in a form that they could appreciate, understand and gain inspiration and strength from.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">In the last decades of British rule, he produced a sophisticated and deeply thought out analysis of Gandhi's work which was the most exalted of its kind. This provided a strong ideology and basis upon which Nehru embarked to build a foreign policy for free india.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">His endearment to the masses was not limited to India. He was internationally  acclaimed, loved and revered for his unstained dignity, composure and excellence. To honor him, an institute of global repute and eminence, the Library of Living Philosophers, brought out an edition on him in 1952. Titled, 'The Philosophy of Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan' it was a detailed critical appreciation of his philosophical doctrines.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">In the global sector, he also played the role of the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, shortly after India’s independence. With the interests of the nation in mind, but also fully aware of those of the world, he was the ideal move forward in helping young independent India grow.</p>

	                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishna with the then American President John. F. Kennedy</p>
	                    </div>




	                    <p style="text-align:justify">When he was appointed as the President, the entire world congratulated India. It had been more her win, than his. A contemporary philosopher, Bertrand Russell hailed his appointment and said, "It is an honour to philosophy that Dr.Radhakrishnan should be President of India and I, as a philosopher, take special pleasure in this. Plato aspired for philosophers to become kings and it is a tribute to India that she should make a philosopher her President".</p>

	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Although he had previous experience in the Cabinet when he served as the Vice President, it was his time in the office as President that was full of challenges. However,none could defeat his spirit.</p>

	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The first task came with 1962’s Sino-India war. India’s loss dealt a blow to its morale. Despite this, a resolute, Dr. S. Radhakrishna proceeded to say, "Owing to the difficult terrain and numerical superiority of the Chinese, we suffered military reverses. These have opened our eyes to the realities of the situation. We are now aware of our inadequacies and are alive to the needs of the present and the demands of the future. The country has developed a new purpose, a new will".</p>

	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">A shaken nation’s strength was well on it’s way to restoration, and it was prepared when Pakistan violated its western frontiers in 1965. His voice rung out once again with words to remind India what it could do when it stood united and that it need not bow down. India, with its confidence instilled again, successfully handled the threat and attack.</p>

	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The philosophical luminary had immense respect and belief in the Indian democracy. In his final broadcast to the Nation as it’s beloved President, on May 12, 1967, he said that despite occasional forebodings to the contrary, the Indian Constitution had worked successfully so far. But democracy, he warned, was more than a system of the Government. "It was a way of life and a regime of civilised conduct of human affairs. We should be the architects of peaceful changes and the advocates of radical reform", he said.</p>

	                    <img class="square" id ="four" src="images1/dr_radhakrishnan3.jpg" alt="" />
	                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">In the Cabinet</p>
	                    </div>

	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">He was indeed one of India’s greatest leaders. Just as, if not more, importantly, he was one of India’s most eminent teachers.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">His early days as a professor were at Presidency College in Madras. An evocative teacher, he was hugely popular among his students. Later he was offered a position in the prestigious Calcutta university even before he turned thirty!</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">He served as Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. In 1939, he was appointed the Vice Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University .Two years later, he took over the Sir Sayaji Rao Chair of Indian Culture and Civilisation in Banaras.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">His intellect was called upon once again when in 1936, he was asked to assume the role of Chair of Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the renowned Oxford University. He retained this for 16 years.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">More praiseworthy than his role as a teacher was his support to the cause of teachers that he demonstrated throughout his life.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Thus, his illustrious character and mind which was bent on serving people, made him one of the most respected of public figures. His farsightedness, dynamic thinking proved invaluable to the nation in the times of its need and to honour the same, the coveted Bharat Ratna was conferred upon him in 1954.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This recognition for his service to mankind was duly deserved. However true recognition for his deeds comes in the form of us constantly reminiscing his philosophies and trying to imbibe them and learn from them, as we march forward into the future.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">As we are faced with new challenges and tasks in the days to come, drawing from the thoughts and ideas of great thinkers such as Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, will better equip us to build our future efficiently and meaningfully, with strong roots, and soaring branches, nurtured and cared for with a sense of honesty, dedication and passion such as his own.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This is true validation for his efforts in the past. This is true preparation for the times to arrive.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:center;">“For the sense of smell, almost more than any other, has the power to recall memories and it is a pity that we use it so little.”</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:-2 0px;text-align:center;"><i> – Rachel Carson</i></p>

                  </div>

                </div>
                <div class="spotlight">
                    <div class="content">
	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Sense of smell can change our moods incessantly and tremendously . Have you ever realized the importance of deodorant that you spray on yourself every morning? A good fragrance can bring freshness to the mind and make you feel more confident. The smell of earth when it rains is a comfort of its own.  Aromas are used to calm the mind and widely used in therapy sessions. The ancient practice of adorning hair with flowers also comes from the same reasons and roots. Thus, it is amply clear how directly our sense of smell can influence how we feel in our environment, not just how we smell it.</p>


	                    <div style="text-align:center;">
	                    <img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/twoone.jpg" alt="" />
	                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kjFRSbCox_k/UbGrWlVZ3zI/AAAAAAAACpI/ P43r4AdnVNw/s1600/4.+Mr+Labrador+and+the+Lily+by+What.jpg</p>
	                    </div>




	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The olfactory system is the sensory system used for smelling. The main olfactory system detects airborne substances, while the accessory system senses fluid-phase stimuli. It gives information to the brain about chemical compositions of objects around. Olfaction in humans has a role in adding emotional attributes to certain events and objects and it is vital in processing our environment and remembering it. </p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">One’s characteristic smell is thought to be an attribute of sophistication and complexity, and more than often, personalities get associated with it. Also, the sense of smell is closely related to the sense of taste as dissolved chemicals in food or drink can evaporate and stimulate olfactory receptors.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">These two would enable one to achieve a lot of things in multitude of fields like entertainment , Science ,etc.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Highly sensitive, we have as many as 350 different receptors identifying distinct, particular parts of molecules. An individual molecule can stimulate different receptors in different ways, leading to innumerable smells being identified.</p>


	                    <div style="text-align:center;">
	                    <img class="square" id ="three" src="images1/twotwo.jpg" alt="" />
	                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/smell-olfaction-epithelium-cilia-olfactory-sensory-neurons-and-basal-cells.jpg</p>
	                    </div>




	                    <p style="text-align:justify">Now delving into the science behind being able to perceive via smell, focus must be brought to the term olfactory receptors (ORs). Also known as odorant receptors, they are present in the cell membranes of olfactory receptor neurons. They are responsible for the detection of odorants (compounds that have an odor). Activated olfactory receptors trigger nerve impulses which transmit information about odor to the brain.</p>

	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Technology is already harnessing the scope of this innate sense and also looking into how to substitute for it, while making it further sensitive.</p>

	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">A step in this direction is an electronic nose. A device intended to detect odors,it was developed in order to mimic human olfaction so that an odor is perceived as a global fingerprint. Essentially the instrument consists of headspace sampling, sensor array, and pattern recognition modules, to generate signal pattern that is used for characterizing odors.</p>



	                    <div style="text-align:center;">
	                    <img class="square" id ="four" src="images1/twothree.jpg" alt="" />
	                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy:http://s3images.coroflot.com/user_files/ 1Ym1HXke2UTyq36M4S1UI9x_0.jpg</p>
	                    </div>



	                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Electronic noses include three major parts: a sample delivery system, a detection system, a computing system.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The sample delivery system enables the generation of the headspace (volatile compounds) of a sample, which is the fraction analyzed. The system then injects this headspace into the detection system of the electronic nose. The sample delivery system is essential to guarantee constant operating conditions.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The detection system, which consists of a sensor set, is the "reactive" part of the instrument. When in contact with volatile compounds, the sensors react, which means they experience a change of electrical properties.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The computing system works to combine the responses of all of the sensors, which represents the input for the data treatment. This part of the instrument performs global fingerprint analysis and provides results and representations that can be easily interpreted.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Another interesting development in this sector is machine Olfaction. This is the automated simulation of the sense of smell.</p>


	                    <div style="text-align:center;">
	                    <img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/twofour.jpg" alt="" />
	                    <p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy:http://www.sigmacom.fr/_media/img/large/img-2404.jpg</p>
	                    </div>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">It is an emerging application of modern engineering where robots or other automated systems are needed to measure the existence of a particular chemical concentration in air. The entire system is a means of converting complex sensor responses into an output that is a qualitative profile of the odor using a complex mixture of chemical volatiles that make up a smell.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Odor localization is the technique and process of finding the location of a volatile chemical source in a certain environment with one or several odor sensors. It is vital for both food searching and danger avoiding.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Mention needs to be made of another extremely useful creation- an olfactometer. This is an instrument used to detect and measure odor dilution.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">They are used to measure intensity,by introducing an odorous gas as a baseline against which other odors are compared. A flow-olfactometer is a complex instrument for creation of well defined, reproducible smell or pain stimuli in the nose without tactile or thermal stimulation.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This technology can be further developed to relieve human moods effectively as smell is responsible for bringing in sense of pleasures, freshness and lucidity of mind.</p>

	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The detection of lung cancer or other medical conditions can employ olfactory means. It can also be used to detect certain bacterial and viral infections. It may also be used as a bomb detection method in airports. Through careful placement of several or more electronic noses and effective computer systems you could triangulate the location of bombs to within a few metres of their location in less than a few seconds.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Thus, the olfactory sense could have unbelievable attributes if we consider its capacity to modulate human behaviors. It has determinant roles in the evolution of human habitat, and, most important of all, in the social behavior.</p>
	                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The beauty of any sense at all shines through best when in association with other senses. As we work to further these developments and focus on impacting society with them, every once in a while, we must remember to breathe it all in and respect our ability to. </p>

									<p style="text-align:justify;">After the sense of vision, sense of hearing or Audition is what enables us to perceive the world better.  Sense of hearing gives a new dimension and dynamic to our experiences. Sense of Hearing which is also known as auditory perception makes us better  aware of the surroundings. Unlike the sense of vision , we can hear all the sounds which we are surrounded with . Sense of hearing also gives us a sense of directionality in a more enhanced way compared to the sense of vision.</p>

									<p style="text-align:justify;">Now let us get to the biological aspect of the sense of hearing, that means science.<br/>Hearing is the detecting and perception of the sound waves in the air. <br/>The organs which look like the horn of a phonograph - Ears; ears focus the sounds waves through the ear canal onto the ear drum. </p>

									</div>




									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The eardrum acts like a diaphragm, and vibrates to the incoming sound waves . These vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear by a chain of tiny bones. From the inner ear, auditory nerve carries the sound information to the brain where it is processed , perceived and stored. One is always listening , from the moment they’re born. 365 days 24 hours, even when you’re sleeping . This is a lot of information the brain is being fed and this information plays an important role in cognitive learning.</p>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Now , there are various reasons why one would want to build a machine counterpart which achieves similar functionalities. Some of them are listed below.</p>
									<ul style="margin-top:-20px;margin-down:-20px;"><li style="text-align:left;">Sound recording and analysis</li><li  style="text-align:left;">Sound amplification</li></ul>
									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">These two would enable one to achieve a lot of things in multitude of fields like entertainment , Science ,etc.</p>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">The machine/technological counterpart to achieve this functionality would be a microphone. A microphone is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. Over these years many different technologies have been developed which lay the basis for a microphone. Let’s look at the major technologies used today in consumer and prosumer fields</p>

									<h2 style="text-align:center;">1. Condenser Microphones</h2>

									<div style="text-align:center;">
									<span class="image"><img src="images1/twelve.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;margin-top:-40px;">Courtsey: http://www.neumann.com/homestudio/pictures/markiii_10045656</p>
									</div>



									<p style="text-align:justify">Condenser Microphones are based on the principle of a capacitor , condenser means capacitor . A capacitor is an electronic component which stores energy in form of an electrostatic field. </p>

									<div style="text-align:center;">
									<img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/thirteen.gif" alt="" />
									<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/images/mic-condenser.gif</p>
									</div>


									<p style="text-align:justify;">A capacitor has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser mic, one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power.</p>

									<p style="text-align:justify;">These kind are the most widely used in electronic gadgets and these tend to be more sensitive compared to others.This technology can also be shrunk in size , making it very versatile.</p>

									<h2 style="text-align:center;">2. Dynamic Microphones (Moving Coil Microphones)</h2>


									<div style="text-align:center;">

									</div>



									<p style="text-align:justify;">The dynamic microphone (also known as the moving-coil microphone) works via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them ideal for onstage use.</p>

									<div style="text-align:center;">

									<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/dynamic-microphone.jpg</p>
									</div>


									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Dynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a loudspeaker, only reversed. A small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying current in the coil through electromagnetic induction. </p>


									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">These are the two widely used microphones, but there is another type of microphones which have been developed and are also being researched into, the MEMS microphone.</p>

									<div style="text-align:center;">

									<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: https://i0.wp.com/www.diffusionmagazine.com/images/akustica_340.jpg</p>
									</div>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The MEMS (Micro-Electrical-Mechanical System) microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. These have revolutionised product designs and have made their way into products like Amazon Alexa , Google Home and certain phones. </p>



									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Microphones have now existed for a long time since their invention in 1876 by Emile Berliner. The growing advancements in the microphone technologies are opening up doors for creative applications. Better microphones along with machine learning and processing via Artificial Intelligence have led to things like Speech Recognition , which would be deemed magic a decade ago. </p>


									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">All in all , sense of hearing is one of the fundamental thing which enhances our perception of our surroundings and goes hand in hand with the sense of vision. The technology for the sense of hearing enables one to share their perception with others . The ability to record , playback and edit these sounds further enables one to build a whole new world of possibilities.</p>

									<p style="text-align:justify;">The interpretation of the surrounding environment using light in the visible spectrum reflected by the objects in the environment is called vision. The resulting perception is also known as visual perception, eyesight or sight. The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system, and are the focus of much research in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and molecular biology, collectively referred to as vision science.</p>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The act of seeing starts when the cornea and then the lens of the eye focuses light from its surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called the retina. The retina is part of the brain that is isolated to serve as a transducer for the conversion of light into neuronal signal. Based on feedback from the visual system, the lens of the eye adjusts its thickness to focus light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, also known as the rods and cones, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are processed via complex feed-forward and feed-back processes by different parts of the brain, from the retina upstream to central ganglia in the brain.</p>

								</div>


									<p style="text-align:justify;">The first device that comes to our mind, when the discussion is about technology substituting our sense of vision, is the camera. In this era, where Digital Single Reflex Lens (DSLR) Cameras are becoming increasingly popular, it would not be wrong to state that the camera is the digital and technological counterpart of our eyes, providing the same functionality: processing visual information (light) into digital information, just as our eyes process light information and biochemically convert them into neuro-electric impulses that are sent to brain.</p>

								</div>



									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.</p>
									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Single-shot capture systems use either one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the primary additive colors red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter.</p>

								<div style="text-align:center;">
									<img class="square" id ="two" src="images1/four.jpg" alt="" />
									<p style="font-size:10px;color:black;">Courtesy: http://chulsa.kr/files//298/1b6e72097c908d170a23138065d9f105.jpg</p>
								</div>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Multi-shot exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens aperture. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple shot method is called Microscanning. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.</p>

								</div>


									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The third method is called scanning because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an image scanner. The linear or tri-linear sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using color co-site sampling) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital rotating line camera offers images of very high total resolution.</p>

								</div>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.</p>
									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Although a camera is functionally largely similar to our eyes, it would not be wrong to state that the image developed does not exactly aid human vision, as the end product of these devices is a digital image or a visual hard copy, which have to be again processed by the eye as an image. Cameras may be similar to our eyes, but cannot be its substitute. Special hardware structures and software algorithms provide machines with the capability to interpret the images coming from a camera or a sensor. These signals from light sensing devices such as cameras or other sensors can be suitably modified to act as a signal source for a computer to interpret or converted into biological impulses that can directly stimulate sense of vision in humans.</p>
									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">One such fascinating piece of technology is the Argus II. In a rare incurable genetic eye disorder <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b>, genetic mutations cause photoreceptors, the cells in the retina at the back of the eye that convert light into an electrical signal the brain can interpret, to stop working and die. Without functioning photoreceptors, people with <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b> go blind. But with the help of a retinal implant, formally known as Retinal Prosthesis System, or simply "bionic eye" called Argus II, some patients with the rare disorder have regained their sight.</p>

								</div>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">At best, these patients could detect only bright light. With the device implanted and turned on, some patients did significantly better on vision tests, like touching a white square on a black monitor and finding a door in real life. Beyond lab tests, visual rehabilitation experts evaluated the effects of the Argus II in the daily lives of patients. For 65% of the study participants, the device positively impacted their lives, improving their quality of life and their ability to perform basic tasks.</p>

								</div>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">The Argus II system has two separate components: a camera and visual processing unit a patient wears, and the surgically implanted receiving antenna and electrodes. The camera and visual processing unit do what the photoreceptors in people with <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b> no longer can: convert visual information from light into electrical signals the brain can understand.</p>
									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">An antenna on the glasses transmits the data from the camera and visual processing unit to a receiving antenna implanted into the patient. The data received goes to an array of 60 electrodes implanted over the macula, the part of the retina that is normally the most sensitive. The electrodes produce small pulses of electricity that stimulate the nerve cells still left in the retina, which then carry information about the stimulation to the part of the brain that interprets this into vision.</p>

								</div>

									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This technology is nothing less than a boon to the medical field, and a strong testimony of the capabilities of technology to aid in cases where medicine and natural physiology cannot achieve any better results. The Argus II received approval for commercial use in the European Union in March 2011. In February 2013, the FDA approved the Argus II under a humanitarian device exemption, authorizing its use for up to 4,000 people in the US per year. The Argus II was initially available at a limited number of clinics in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, at an EU market price of US$115,000. When the Argus II launched in the United States in February 2013, Second Sight announced that it would be priced at around $150,000, excluding the cost of surgery and usage training. In August 2013, Second Sight announced that reimbursement payments had been approved for the Argus II for blind Medicare recipients in the United States.</p>
									<p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Though Argus II can provide satisfactory results, it is evident that the device can target only one particular disorder, with results better than before but not perfect sight. Advanced research is being undertaken to provide similar technological aid to serve a wider spectrum of visual disabilities, and also enable mass production of the same to provide the device at affordable prices. </p>
