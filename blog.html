											<h3><b>Biological Aspect Of Perception</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>The interpretation of the surrounding environment using light in the visible spectrum reflected by the objects in the environment is called vision. The resulting perception is also known as visual perception, eyesight or sight. The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system, and are the focus of much research in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and molecular biology, collectively referred to as vision science.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">The act of seeing starts when the cornea and then the lens of the eye focuses light from its surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called the retina. The retina is part of the brain that is isolated to serve as a transducer for the conversion of light into neuronal signal. Based on feedback from the visual system, the lens of the eye adjusts its thickness to focus light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, also known as the rods and cones, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are processed via complex feed-forward and feed-back processes by different parts of the brain, from the retina upstream to central ganglia in the brain.</p>

											<h3><b>Digital Vision</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>The first device that comes to our mind, when the discussion is about technology substituting our sense of vision, is the camera. In this era, where Digital Single Reflex Lens (DSLR) Cameras are becoming increasingly popular, it would not be wrong to state that the camera is the digital and technological counterpart of our eyes, providing the same functionality: processing visual information (light) into digital information, just as our eyes process light information and biochemically convert them into neuro-electric impulses that are sent to brain.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">Single-shot capture systems use either one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the primary additive colors red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">Multi-shot exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens aperture. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple shot method is called Microscanning. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">The third method is called scanning because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an image scanner. The linear or tri-linear sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using color co-site sampling) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital rotating line camera offers images of very high total resolution.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">Although a camera is functionally largely similar to our eyes, it would not be wrong to state that the image developed does not exactly aid human vision, as the end product of these devices is a digital image or a visual hard copy, which have to be again processed by the eye as an image. Cameras may be similar to our eyes, but cannot be its substitute. Special hardware structures and software algorithms provide machines with the capability to interpret the images coming from a camera or a sensor. These signals from light sensing devices such as cameras or other sensors can be suitably modified to act as a signal source for a computer to interpret or converted into biological impulses that can directly stimulate sense of vision in humans.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">One such fascinating piece of technology is the Argus II. In a rare incurable genetic eye disorder <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b>, genetic mutations cause photoreceptors, the cells in the retina at the back of the eye that convert light into an electrical signal the brain can interpret, to stop working and die. Without functioning photoreceptors, people with <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b> go blind. But with the help of a retinal implant, formally known as Retinal Prosthesis System, or simply "bionic eye" called Argus II, some patients with the rare disorder have regained their sight.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">At best, these patients could detect only bright light. With the device implanted and turned on, some patients did significantly better on vision tests, like touching a white square on a black monitor and finding a door in real life. Beyond lab tests, visual rehabilitation experts evaluated the effects of the Argus II in the daily lives of patients. For 65% of the study participants, the device positively impacted their lives, improving their quality of life and their ability to perform basic tasks.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">The Argus II system has two separate components: a camera and visual processing unit a patient wears, and the surgically implanted receiving antenna and electrodes. The camera and visual processing unit do what the photoreceptors in people with <b><i>Retinitis Pigmentosa</i></b> no longer can: convert visual information from light into electrical signals the brain can understand.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">An antenna on the glasses transmits the data from the camera and visual processing unit to a receiving antenna implanted into the patient. The data received goes to an array of 60 electrodes implanted over the macula, the part of the retina that is normally the most sensitive. The electrodes produce small pulses of electricity that stimulate the nerve cells still left in the retina, which then carry information about the stimulation to the part of the brain that interprets this into vision.</p>

										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">This technology is nothing less than a boon to the medical field, and a strong testimony of the capabilities of technology to aid in cases where medicine and natural physiology cannot achieve any better results. The Argus II received approval for commercial use in the European Union in March 2011. In February 2013, the FDA approved the Argus II under a humanitarian device exemption, authorizing its use for up to 4,000 people in the US per year. The Argus II was initially available at a limited number of clinics in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, at an EU market price of US$115,000. When the Argus II launched in the United States in February 2013, Second Sight announced that it would be priced at around $150,000, excluding the cost of surgery and usage training. In August 2013, Second Sight announced that reimbursement payments had been approved for the Argus II for blind Medicare recipients in the United States.</p>
										<p style="margin-top:-20px;">Though Argus II can provide satisfactory results, it is evident that the device can target only one particular disorder, with results better than before but not perfect sight. Advanced research is being undertaken to provide similar technological aid to serve a wider spectrum of visual disabilities, and also enable mass production of the same to provide the device at affordable prices. </p>
